Life
====

Life is my firstirst iOS App. It was meant as a way to practice OpenGL. It is a reproduction of a well known simulation, 
named Conway's Game of Life. Some of the features of this application include OpenGL ES 2.0 shading, and being able to 
render several hundreds of cells at one time. Long press to reset the simulation, and tap the screen for a fun surprise.
